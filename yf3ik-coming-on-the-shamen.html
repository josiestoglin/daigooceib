The fallacy that peacekeeper is an S-tier character is honestly thought of only by people who dont even play peacekeeper. The real peacekeeper is a struggle snorefest of a character with options that are far too costly.

TL;DR: I took ayahuasca one time, got a surprising message, and then lost all interest in psychedelics, then produced a concept album of songs inspired by the experience. I've never written down my Ayahuasca experience before, so thanks for reading. I'm reasonably experienced with psychedelics, starting as a teenager with mushrooms and LSD.

Everyone is writing about their version of Christianity so I thought I would explain how I became a strict traditionalist with what many here would consider a very narrow view of Christianity. When I first became Christian I was a left libertarian. I was a strong proponent of abortions, gay marriage, and social freedom.
